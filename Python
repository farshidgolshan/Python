Hi, this is Bing. I can try to help you with your code.blush

I think the problem is in your dictionary comprehension syntax. You are missing a comma after the question name in the inner dictionary. This causes a syntax error and prevents the creation of the answer column.

According to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary-comprehension/, the general syntax for dictionary comprehension is:

new_dictionary = {key: value for (key,value) in iterable}

In your case, you should write something like this:

`{

Get the question name using f-string
f'Question {question + 1}':  # Add a comma here!

Generate a random answer for this question based on a weighted choice with probabilities proportional to difficulty level and desired percentage
You can change this to another distribution if you want
random.choices(
possible_answers,
weights=[

Assign a higher weight for no answer if difficulty level is low or desired percentage is low
(1 - difficulty) * (1 - percentage),

Assign a lower weight for wrong answers if difficulty level is high or desired percentage is high
difficulty * (1 - percentage) / 5,
difficulty * (1 - percentage) / 5,
difficulty * (1 - percentage) / 5,
difficulty * (1 - percentage) / 5,
difficulty * (1 - percentage) / 5,

Assign a higher weight for correct answer if difficulty level is high and desired percentage is high
difficulty * percentage
]
)[0],
}`

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.blush
